    Overview and History
BMW Motorsport GmbH was founded in 1972 as BMW’s dedicated motorsport division to handle racing activities and performance models development. It initially focused on touring car competitions and gradually expanded into multiple racing categories, including endurance, rally, and formula racing. The division became widely recognized for its engineering excellence and consistent racing success in series such as DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters), the World Touring Car Championship, and IMSA SportsCar Championship. BMW M GmbH, closely linked to BMW Motorsport, produces high-performance street vehicles based on motorsport technology, with the famous "M" models like M3, M4, and M5 tracing their lineage back to racing development efforts.
